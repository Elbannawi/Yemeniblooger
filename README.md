        <p id="socotra">Socotra is a Yemeni archipelago belonging to the Hadramout region, consisting of six islands on the Indian Ocean off the coast of the Horn of Africa near the Gulf of Aden, located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) east of the coast of Somalia and 380 kilometers (240 miles) south of the Arabian Peninsula. The archipelago includes a main island, which is Socotra, and five other islands, which are Darsa, Samha, Abd al-Kuri, Sayal Abd al-Kuri, Sayal Socotra, and seven rocky islands, which are Sirah, Radd, Adlah, Karshih, Sihar, Thaan Thal and Jalis. The length of the coastline is 300 km, the capital of the island is Hadiboh, and the population of the island, according to the 2004 census, was 175,020 thousand people. The fame of Socotra and its historical importance go back to the beginning of the Stone Age, the flourishing of trade in sacred goods, and the activity of the ancient trade route - the frankincense road. Socotra was famous for producing dew, a type of incense, and for producing “Socotra patience” as the finest type of patience. Its importance increased and was mentioned to the peoples of the civilizations of the ancient world. Those who looked at the sacred commodities with a look of reverence for incense, myrrh, aloes, frankincense and various spices, and they called the land that produces these commodities the holy land and for this reason Socotra Island was called by the ancient Greeks and Romans the island of happiness.<br>

The island's long isolation from Africa and the Arabian Peninsula resulted in a unique and unusual level of vital settlement on the island, as well as in the social level of the island's inhabitants.<br></p>

    <p class="Geography">Public transportation in Socotra is limited to a few minibuses, or renting an SUV with driver.<br>
The island of Socotra is connected to the Yemeni mainland through ships that depart from a port located five kilometers south of Hadibu and reach the city of Mukalla on the coast of Yemen.<br> Based on the information received, the voyage takes from 2 to 3 days and is mostly for the transportation of goods. Maritime navigation to Socotra stops for at least four months every year.<br> This is because of the windy season.<br>

Yemen Airways and Saeed Airlines operate separate flights from Sana'a, Aden and Mukalla airports to Socotra airport.</p>

<p class="Geography">The population of the island in 1966 was estimated at about 16,000 people, while in 1973 it reached 30,000 people.<br> The results of the general census of housing and population carried out by the Republic of Yemen in 1994 AD stated that their number reached 44,880 people, and according to the census of Yemen 2004, the population reached 65,514 people.<br>

The inhabitants of Socotra are generally distinguished by the lack of ethnic disharmony, as studies indicate that they are descended from the Himyarite population and the displaced Yemenis from Al-Mahra and Africa. Although waves of Portuguese and Romans came to this island before them with the aim of occupying it, in addition to the English who came recently in 1954 AD, this did not happen.<br> It constitutes in itself the crystallization of distinct population groups that have their own character.<br> This indicates a clear indication that the island of Socotra constitutes the general population of pure Yemeni origins, which gives this region an element of geological strength in addition to the rest of the aforementioned elements.<br>

The origins of the inhabitants of Socotra Island go back to Mahra bin Haidan, as stated in the book Lisan al-Arab by al-Hamdani, and the Himyarite tribes, and there are some clans whose origins go back to Hadramout and the Sultanate of Oman.<br> The island of Socotra was the capital of the Mahri sultanate until 1967, when it fell to members of the National Liberation Front coming from Yemen, and was annexed to South Yemen and then to the Republic of Yemen.<br></p>
